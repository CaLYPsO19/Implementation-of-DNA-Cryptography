DNA cryptography represents a cutting-edge approach to securing information through the application of biotechnology and genetics.
In this innovative field, the fundamental building blocks of life, DNA sequences, are leveraged as a medium for encoding and decoding sensitive data
Implementation of DNA cryptography involves converting digital information into DNA code, using a predefined encoding scheme.
This process often employs the four nucleotide bases of DNA (adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine) as the equivalent of binary digits, creating a unique genetic sequence that mirrors the original digital data.
To decode the information, specialized tools and techniques, such as DNA sequencing technologies, are utilized to interpret the genetic sequence back into its digital form.
